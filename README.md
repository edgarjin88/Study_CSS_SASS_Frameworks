## Sass and Css Practice

This repository is for my study and future reference purpose. 


You can find the original code from the udemy lecture from [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)


Following the lectures, there could be some typos or minor changes, so I highly recommand to refer to the orignial lectures git repository :).
